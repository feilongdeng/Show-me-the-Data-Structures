
For this problem, I use a recursion to get into the directories which includes input the suffix and path.
Basically, I create a files inside the find_files function and directories from the suffix and path.  
Assum the number of files in current dir is n, the max depth recursion is m, time complexity is O(m * n).

Run time complexity: O(m*n)
Space complexity: O(n)
